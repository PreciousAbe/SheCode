      <h2>Health Benefit of Tigernut Drink</h2>
      <img src="Yonut.jpeg" alt="Tigernut Drink" />
      <p>
        Tigernut milk drink is one of the tastiest and most delicious drink that
        is made in <strong>Nigeria.</strong>
        <br />
        This drink is quite popular in Northern Nigeria, where they call it
        ‚Äúkunun aya‚Äù. Here in Southern Nigeria, we had nothing to do with the
        milk until recently. We just buy the nuts ‚Äúaki Hausa‚Äô and snack on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you live outside <strong>Nigeria</strong>, I think you will find them
        in African shops. There is so much you can do with these nuts, you can
        choose to eat them as they come or combine them with dates to make a
        delicious milk drink. Since I learned about the health benefits and the
        fact that I could extract the milk, I have settled on a simple
        two-ingredient recipe for tiger nut milk.
      </p>

      <h3 class="benefit">Health benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the nutrient required for our optimum health is naturally
        embedded in certain fruits and Vegetables. Here are some of te benefits
        of drinking Yonut Milk
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Tiger nuts contain over 15 different elements and nutrients including
          fiber, calcium, potassium, Zinc, Iron, and Vitamins. Fiber is good for
          an easy bowel movement and may help with food digestion and also
          prevent constipation in kids and adults.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have used this milk historically to <em>boost libido</em> and
          increase sperm count. It acts as a natural aphrodisiac. It could just
          be what you need to get back your sex lifeüòÄ.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most important tiger nut milk benefit is surely the fact that it
          tastes so good and quenches your thirst.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain researchers found out that tiger nut extract could fight some
          harmful bacteria in the human body.
        </li>
        <p>
          Hence, drinking this milk helps your immune system and ultimately
          helps in establishing a defense against bacteria like E.coli,
          staphylococcus and Salmonella Typhi.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The following are the ingredients for making Yonut drink e.g Tigernut
        seed, Ginger, Cococnut, Dates and Water.
